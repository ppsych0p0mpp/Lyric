            [Intro] <br>
            Whatever <br>
            Dre, just let it run <br>
            Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit <br>
            Aiyyo... this song is for anyone... fuck it <br>
            Just shut up and listen, aiyyo <br>
        </p>

            [Verse 1] <br>
            I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag <br>
            Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be <br>
            The most meanest MC on this - on this Earth <br>
            And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse <br>
            And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works <br>
            And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve <br>
            All this tension dispensing these sentences <br>
            Getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest <br>
            And I rest again peacefully (peacefully) <br>
            But at least have the decency in you <br>
            To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out <br>
            In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter <br>
            Do not come and speak to me (speak to me) <br>
            I don't know you and no <br>
            I don't owe you a motherfucking thing <br>
            I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think <br>
            I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick <br>
            If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty) <br>
            No patience is in me and if you offend me <br>
            I'm lifting you 10 feet (lifting you 10 feet)... in the air <br>
            I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you <br>
            Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit <br>
            I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe <br>
            I'm tired of all you (of all you) <br>
            I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be it's just me <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            [Chorus] <br>
            And I am, whatever you say I am <br>
            If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? <br>
            In the paper, the news every day I am <br>
            Radio won't even play my jam <br>
            'Cause I am, whatever you say I am <br>
            If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? <br>
            In the paper, the news every day I am <br>
            I don't know, it's just the way I am <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            [Verse 2] <br>
            Sometimes I just feel like my father <br>
            I hate to be bothered <br>
            With all of this nonsense it's constant <br>
            And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content - <br>
            - the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses" <br>
            And all of this controversy circles me <br>
            And it seems like the media immediately <br>
            Points a finger at me (finger at me) <br>
            So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie <br>
            Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up <br>
            When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up <br>
            With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too <br>
            When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school <br>
            And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn)... and the heroin <br>
            Where were the parents at? And look where it's at <br>
            Middle America, now it's a tragedy <br>
            Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city <br>
            Having this happening (this happening) <br>
            Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way) <br>
            But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire <br>
            To burn and it's burning and I have returned <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            [Chorus] <br>
            And I am, whatever you say I am <br>
            If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? <br>
            In the paper, the news every day I am <br>
            Radio won't even play my jam <br>
            'Cause I am, whatever you say I am <br>
            If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? <br>
            In the paper, the news every day I am <br>
            I don't know it's just the way I am <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            [Verse 3] <br>
            I'm so sick and tired of being admired <br>
            That I wish that I would just die or get fired <br>
            And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables <br>
            I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is... " <br>
            And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation <br>
            That got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations <br>
            And I just do not got the patience (got the patience) <br>
            To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think <br>
            I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk <br>
            With an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep asking <br>
            The same fucking questions (fucking questions) <br>
            What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in <br>
            The why, the who what when, the where, and the how <br>
            'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out <br>
            'Cause they driving me crazy (driving me crazy)... I can't take it <br>
            I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit<br> 
            And I'm thankful for every fan that I get<br> 
            But I can't take a shit, in the bathroom <br>
            Without someone standing by it <br>
            No, I won't sign your autograph <br>
            You can call me an asshole I'm glad <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            [Chorus] <br>
            'Cause I am, whatever you say I am <br>
            If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? <br>
            In the paper, the news every day I am <br>
            Radio won't even play my jam <br>
            'Cause I am, whatever you say I am <br>
            If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? <br>
            In the paper, the news every day I am <br>
            I don't know, it's just the way I am <br>
